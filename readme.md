StashHouse.sh
====================

A simple backup controller for S3 and MediaTemple
---------------------

<more info here soon>

StashHouse is a simple shell script that backups web directories and databases 
based on Media Temple's file structure. However, it's shell script and can be easily changed to
do whatever function you need it to. 


Depends on the Ruby runtime and the s3cmd lib
